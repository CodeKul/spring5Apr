- Aspect Oriented Programming
- major feature
- helps in breaking down the logic of the program into several distinct parts called as concerns
- cross cutting concerns is the functions which span multiple points of an application
- cross cutting concerns help in increasing modularity & separate it from the business logic of an application

Need for Spring AOP
- provides pluggable way of dynamically adding additional concern before, after or around the actual logic

Terminologies:
1. Aspect
2. Join Point
	- a point during the execution of a program, such as a method or handling of an exception
	- a specific point in application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values.
	- represents a method execution
3. Advice
	- action taken either before or after the execution of method
	- piece of code
4. PointCut
	- basically those JoinPoints where we can put our advice
	- subset of JoinPoints
	- expression that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not.
	- Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language

Types of Advice
1. Before
	- run the advice before the execution of method
2. After
	- run the advice after the execution of method regardless of the outcome
3. After-returning
	- run the advice after the execution of method only after the successful completion of the method
4. After-throwing
	- run the advice after the execution of method only if the method exits throwing an exception
5. Around
	- run the advice before & after advice method
	- most important & powerful advice


Steps:
1. Add AOP dependency
2.
